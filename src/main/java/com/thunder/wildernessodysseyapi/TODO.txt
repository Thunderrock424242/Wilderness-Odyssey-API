// TODO: all code is generated by ai because i am learning but need things done for my modpack once done coding and helping ai learn to talk to a modder and make a commision to fix the files.

- make sure all packages work.

- make sure the blacklist checker works

- most packages say what features they include

- the bunker structure though registers a bunker that is made using world edit so i would like if you can make it so the structure is intagrated well into the terrian placed in a plains biome and you can make a block maybe a blue block and we can use it to help the structure look like it fits into the world idk how it would work. and i want the player to spawn inside the structure but i already got that part down. added a new thing adding the structure to the biome so try to intagrate the bunker structure package into the world gen package.

- higher smoke package make smoke go higher

- ocean package make the water compatiple with shaders and have tides and have things that are inlcuded in the physics mod.

- sky beam package do what this video does https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKXTGbp6AMk&t=42s

- the cloak package i want to be like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZmEYYs0ZKs&t=293s but go to the cloak part.

- for the world gen package i want it to allow me to be able to disable spqawning of certin poi's features and structures.

- make sure mod conflict checker works.

- trying to make a biome to put a metor crator and bunker structure. try to move the bunker structure package into the world gen one.

that should be it any questions just ask me aka thunderrock424242

also most of the code is in forge but i am trying to convert to neoforge.
