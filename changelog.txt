Fixed:
-



Removed:

API Changes:
- updated to latest gradle and neo

! added a spawn block for you to spawn at when our starter structure loads

! added a wave render to added waves and tides (wip) todo
!! a lot more coming and this update will take a couple of weeks or months.
* removed global chat as it's a bad idea for now.
!! added a mod conflict checker this is to make sure 2 mods are not overlapping this also comes with some neat features todo
* added exception logger so we can find major mod issues and report them.

* added a memory util command to keep a eye on memory usage.
* added a cloak todo
* added sky mean todo
!! added a rendering engine that will help transfer resources from the cpu to the gpu.





API/Modpack bugs:
!! api bug: water mobs sink to the bottom and die for some strange reason. squids are also stuck at the surface and maybe its due to waves.todo


Note:
!! in the future hopefully get the mod big globe to work with the pack but its incompatible with territh and wwoo
!! hopefully also add this mod when more compat is out https://modrinth.com/datapack/jjthunder-to-the-max

Dev Notes:-
!! Remember this is an alpha, so expect bugs and a lot of new changes and things that are not ready yet.
